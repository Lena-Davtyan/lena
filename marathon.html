  <p><b>Ariana Grande-Butera</b> (born June 26, 1993) is
  an American singer and actress. Born in <ins>Boca Raton, Florida,</ins> Grande began her career at age 15 in 
  the 2008 Broadway musical 13. She rose to fame for her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series
  <b>Victorious</b> (2010–2013) and Sam & Cat (2013–2014). She subsequently signed with <ins>Republic Records in 2011</ins> after the label's executives
  discovered YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[1] Yours Truly (2013), topped
  the US Billboard 200 chart, while its lead single, "The Way", charted in the top ten of the US <ins>Billboard Hot 100</ins>. Upon release, critics
  compared Grande to Mariah Carey for her wide vocal range and whistle register.
  
<br><br><em>Grande</em> maintained her pop and R&B sound on her second and third studio albums, <b>My Everything (2014)</b>, and <b>Dangerous Woman (2016)</b>,
 with the former exploring EDM and producing the UK number-one singles <b>"Problem"</b>, and <b>"Bang Bang"</b>, and the latter becoming her first of
 four consecutive number-one albums in the UK Singles Chart. Her personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio
 albums, <b>Sweetener (2018)</b> and <b>Thank U, Next (2019)</b>, which were both critical and commercial successes. The former won Grande a Grammy
 Award for <ins>Best Pop Vocal Album</ins>, while the latter broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album, and was nominated
 for the Album of the Year.[2] The singles <ins>"Thank U, Next", "7 Rings"</ins>, and <ins>"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored"</ins> made Grande the
 first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, and the first woman to succeed herself at the
 top of the UK. In 2020, her collaborations <b>"Stuck with U"</b> with Justin Bieber and <b>"Rain on Me"</b> with Lady Gaga helped her break the record 
 for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100. Grande's R&B-influenced sixth studio album, <b>Positions (2020)</b>, and its title track, debuted
 at number-one in the UK and US.</p>
